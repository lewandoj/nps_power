# The effects of scale coarseness on statistical power 
This simulation evaluates the effect of reducing the number of bins on a scale such as a survey (known as scale coarseness). A popular method of evaluating user sentiment from surveys is to calculate a Net Promoter Score (NPS). This simulation demonstrates how using NPS rather than a simple average score can reduce the chances of detecting changes in user sentiment.
